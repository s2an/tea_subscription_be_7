Take-Home Back End Prompt
Tea Subscription Service
You will create a Rails API for a Tea Subscription Service.

Requirements:
At a minimum, you must create:

An endpoint to subscribe a customer to a tea subscription
An endpoint to cancel a customer’s tea subscription
An endpoint to see all of a customer’s subsciptions (active and cancelled)
Beyond the base requirements, include any additional endpoints you’d like, but be mindful of your time. You don’t need to go overboard, consider what might be necessary to achieve MVP so that this API is easy to understand and consume by a Frontend Developer.
